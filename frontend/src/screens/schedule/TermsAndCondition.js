// <h1> TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>;

// <p>
// 	“we”, “us”, “Absolute Health” refers to the clinic run by BB Osteopaths Limited. “you”, “client”, “patient” refers to
// 	a customer of Absolute Health. GENERAL By becoming or being a customer at the Absolute Health Clinic, your agreement
// 	with these terms and conditions is implied. These terms and conditions may be updated at our discretion without prior
// 	notice. It is your responsibility to read and understand these terms and conditions, a written copy of which is
// 	available on request. MAKING BOOKINGS You may book appointments with us in person, by telephone or by email. Advanced
// 	bookings may be refused to clients who have missed appointments without giving at least 48 hours notice. The contents
// 	of the clinic diary are confidential. You should not attempt to view the diary when making a booking in person.
// 	ARRIVAL TIMES We recommend that you arrive before your appointment time, allowing sufficient travel time during the
// 	traffic rush hours. If you arrive more than 10 minutes late for your appointment, we may reschedule your treatment for
// 	another time and you may be charged a late cancellation fee. If you arrive late and agree to receive a shorter
// 	treatment than normal, you agree to pay the full cost of that treatment. APPOINTMENT CONFIRMATION AND CANCELLATIONS If
// 	you provide a landline telephone number (rather than a mobile telephone number), we will attempt to call you before
// 	the day of your treatment to confirm the time and date of your booking. If you provide us with a mobile telephone
// 	number, we may send you a SMS text message to confirm the time and date of your booking. If you provide us with an
// 	email address, we may send you an email message to confirm the time and date of your booking. If you give us less than
// 	48 hours notice when cancelling a booking or do not attend an appointment, you agree to pay the cancellation charge of
// 	£25 or the full cost of your treatment (whichever amount is smaller). These charges may be waived in exceptional
// 	circumstances. We sometimes need to contact you to change the time and/or date of your booking. Whenever possible, we
// 	will give you as much notice as we can when doing this. In the instance of unforeseen staff illness, we may be forced
// 	to reschedule your appointment at short notice. No discounts will be offered in these circumstances. TREATMENTS Our
// 	practitioners are not obliged to treat you if they deem treatment is not appropriate for any reason. All new
// 	Chiropody/Podiatry and Osteopathy patients will only be treated after receiving an initial consultation which may
// 	involve physical examination or advice. If, after consultation, no treatment is to be offered, only the consultation
// 	fee will be payable. Before receiving certain treatments (e.g. for verrucae or nail surgery) you may be asked to
// 	complete a consent form. If you refuse to sign such a consent form then that treatment will not be performed. If you
// 	have read and decline to accept these terms and conditions, no treatment will be offered. PAYMENT We may ask you for
// 	full payment, or a deposit in advance, in order to secure any booking. This payment is non-refundable in the absence
// 	of mitigating circumstances but may be put towards the cost of future treatment or any cancellation charges that
// 	apply. Mitigating circumstances include genuine, unforeseen ill health or personal crisis. In the majority of cases,
// 	payment is completed on the day of treatment. If you do not pay in full on the day of your treatment, we will not
// 	accept further bookings until any outstanding amounts have been paid in full. We accept payment by cash, or debit &
// 	credit cards (but not cheques or Lavish/Tesco vouchers). Receipts for debit & credit cards can be provided as an email
// 	or SMS text message. A printed receipt can be requested if needed. If your treatment relates to an insurance claim and
// 	we accept you as a patient, having agreed fees in advance with your insurer, we will invoice your insurer after you
// 	have been discharged (you will not need to pay up front). If you have cover with a private (cash-back) health scheme -
// 	e.g. SimplyHealth - you will need to pay for each treatment and claim back the cost yourself (a receipt will be
// 	provided for this purpose). To avoid disappointment, please check with your insurer before receiving treatment that
// 	the therapy is covered by your scheme. Podiatry and Osteopathy treatments should be covered by all health insurance
// 	schemes. PAYMENT BY TELEPHONE We can accept payment by telephone using a debit or credit card. To do this we need your
// 	full card details and the address where the card is registered. All security data will be handled in the strictest
// 	confidence and will not be retained in the clinic after payment is authorised. If required, we can post a clinic
// 	receipt to you, if you provide us with a stamped, addressed envelope. COMPLAINTS If you have a complaint about the
// 	service you have received at Absolute Health please speak to one of the clinic managers. If the clinic manager is
// 	unable to resolve your complaint at the time, you may put your complaint in writing to the directors of BB Osteopaths
// 	Limited for further consideration. If your complaint relates to Osteopathic treatment please request a separate
// 	Complaints Procedure form. CONDUCT We will refuse treatment to customers who behave in an ill-mannered, aggressive or
// 	hostile way towards any member of staff. Customers who bring children with them are responsible for keeping the
// 	children quiet and under control during their visit and if any child causes disruption we may cancel your appointment
// 	and ask you to leave. REFUNDS At our discretion, we can offer a full refund on retail products if they are unused, in
// 	their original packaging, in a fully saleable condition and are accompanied by proof of purchase, presented within 28
// 	days of purchase. We do not offer a refund for treatments unless we acknowledge that the service received was below
// 	the professional standard we strive to achieve. DATA HANDLING / PRIVACY Any information you give us during your
// 	consultation or treatment is protected under the Data Protection Act. Your records may be kept on paper or
// 	electronically. We will not pass any of your details on to anyone outside of Absolute Health without your express
// 	permission. An example of someone we might contact on your behalf is your doctor if we feel you need medical
// 	investigation of some kind. We may use your contact details to send you (via post or electronically) information about
// 	new treatments, newsletters or special offers unless you write to us to decline this service. We will only use your
// 	telephone number for contacting you about your appointment. We will never use your telephone number for 3rd party
// 	marketing purposes. CLINIC NOISE WHILST 'QUIET TREATMENTS' ARE IN PROGRESS We often provide quiet, relaxing treatments
// 	to customers; for example, massage, Bowen therapy, reflexology. We will let you know when this is happening. We ask
// 	that you switch your mobile telephone to silent and do not raise your voice during these times.
