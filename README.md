# Family_Dental_Clinic

Family Dental is a dental clinic management system that has a good member base and reputation. 
It’s a solution for the family dental clinic to manage patients more easily and conveniently. 
Therefore, an automated system is implemented under 8 functions through this project.
They are User management, Inventory control management, Diagnosis info Management, 
Feedback and Q&A Management, Appointment handling, Doctor's article blog management, 
Patient's medical history management, and Schedule handling. Therefore, this computerized 
system helps to overcome issues in the manual system and brings out a significant improvement 
for the dental clinic. This approach is good to maintain everything in a computer-based manner. 
For this project, the Family dental clinic management system, our team members choose a set of 
functionalities after discussing how to create a web application to overcome the challenges faced 
in the manual system. We have decided to use MERN Stack as the technology.

We used MERN Stack technology to develop the Integrated Family Dental Clinic System. The 
main reason for using these technologies in 2022 is that they are a popular framework because 
they are highly adaptable, cost-effective, and cloud compatible. 

WHAT IS MERN STACK? 

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up 
the stack.
● MongoDB - document database
● Express(.js) - Node.js web framework 
● React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework 
● Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web 
framework and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform.
We utilized React.js for the front end and Node.js with Express for backend development. React 
is excellent at handling stateful, data-driven interfaces with minimal code and suffering, and it 
comes with all the bells and whistles we'd expect from a modern web framework, including 
excellent support for forms, error handling, events, and lists, among other features.

If our app maintains data (user profiles, content, comments, uploads, events, and so on), we'll 
need a database that's as simple and easy to use as React, Express, and Node. We've chosen 
MongoDB Atlas as the database. MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based relational database 
management system that is highly safe, long-lasting, and completely automated.

The LTS version of Node.js 16.13.1 is used as a node server to connect to databases. We may 
also connect to Express.js functions that power our application by sending XML HTTP Requests 
(XHRs), GETs or POSTs from our React.js front-end. To access and change data in our 
MongoDB database, those functions used MongoDB's Node.js drivers, either via callbacks or 
promises. We utilized the Visual Studio Code editor to develop and debug our web application, it 
was redesigned and optimized for this purpose. We utilized Postman to drive the backend before 
constructing the front end. Postman is an API developer collaboration platform.
